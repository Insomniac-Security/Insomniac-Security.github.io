|![Und3rf10w]({{ site.url }}/echavarria.jpg) | **Jonathan Echavarria** ([@und3rf10w](https://twitter.com/und3rf10w)) has over half a decade of experience in the Information security industry, which sounds like a lot if you don't think about it too hard. His primary interests include adversary emulation, reverse engineering, and good old fashioned breaking into networks. Currently, he works as a Red Team Operator while performing security research in his spare time. He holds a number of industry certifications including OSCE, OSCP and CEH.|
|![violentlydave]({{ site.url }}/switzer.jpg) | **David Switzer** ([@violentlydave](https://twitter.com/violentlydave)) is a red team operator who has 20+ years of experience in systems and network security.  Some alphabet Soup: GSE #136, OSCE, Multiple GIAC certs, CISSP and ITILv3 (I keep it gangsta).  His obsessions/amusements include RF, wireless networks, hardware hacking, and other expensive time sinks.|

Jonathan and David work at [ReliaQuest](https://www.reliaquest.com) in Tampa, Florida, a leading co-management security provider.
